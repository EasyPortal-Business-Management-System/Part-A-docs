![Application Dataflow Diagram](/docs/Dataflow_Diagram.jpeg)

## Application Archtecture
The below diagram shows the overall architecture and structure of the application. Generally the application can be broken down into three main areas; the Client side, Server side and the Database. For the application, we have chosen to use a MERN structure, with each component included in the diagram to show its function.

## User Stories
The user stories below are focused on the needs and experiences of the employees and employers who would be using the EasyPortal application. Whilst a guest, or non-signed in user may be considered for application development, this is not relevant to EasyPortal since it will essentially be used within a private environment. Since the rosters and pay information of employees is private business information, a user without an account will only be able to view the home page and be prompted to sign in or create their account. 

#### Employee:
- As an employee, I want to be able to easily check my roster without having to go into my workplace.
- As an employee, I want to see my pay estimate for the week so I can know what I'm getting paid.
- As an employee,

#### Employer:
- As an employer, I want to be able to view the current employee roster, so I can see how well staffed my business is. 
- As an employer, I want to be able to add a new shift to the roster.
- As an employer, I want to be able to edit an existing shift in the roster.
- As an employer, I want to be able to delete an existing shift in the roster.
